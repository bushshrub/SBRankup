# Rankups configuration

# Example

# rankups:
#   A:
#     nextrank: B # Put the name of the next rank in here
#     cost: 0 # First one, put 0. This means the player is by default already this rank
#             # This is the island level required to rankup to this rank.
#     actions: # Actions that will be performed on rankup
#       - <addgroup> B


# Give your players the permission sbrankup.rank.[rank name] so the plugin knows their rank.
# For the last rank, please give your players the permission sbrankup.rank.lastrank so the plugin knows
# that the player is on the last rank
#   lastrank:
#       name: Z
#       cost: 1000

# If this looks similar to EZRanksLite/Pro, yes, I got my idea from there
