# Rankups configuration

# Example

# rankups:
#   A:
#     nextrank: B # Put the name of the next rank in here
#     actions: # Actions that will be performed on rankup
#       - <addgroup> B


# If this looks similar to EZRanksLite/Pro, yes, I got my idea from there
# Action list:
# <addgroup> [group] (world) - adds the player to a permission group
# <removegroup> [group] (world) - removes the player from a permissions group
# <addpermission> [permission] (world) - adds a permission
